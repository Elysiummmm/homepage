# My homepage
This is the source code for [my website](https://ely.sium.dev).
The site is built in just HTML, CSS, and JS (and some GLSL), so there's no prerequisites or anything to work with it - you can just open the `index.html` file and it'll work.

### Usage
You're allowed to fork/copy/do whatever with the page **as long as you change the non-source code page content (names, projects, etc.).**
